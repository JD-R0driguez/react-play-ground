                        My interest in web development started back in 2020 when I decided to tackle creating
                        a website for my woodworking business. â€” turns out attempting to create a custom button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

                        I have a background in mechatronics engineer and love programming because it is so practical, and I can solve real-world challenges with it. For me, programming is a tool to express myself in a creative way. Plus, there is so much to
                        explore that always keeps me excited!
                    </p>

                        Today I'm enthralled by web development. Creating new experiences,
                        implementing eye pleasing designs and making them come to life with animation is what I do best.
